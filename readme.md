# Dries's Dotfiles

## What Is This?

This repository serves as my way to help me setup and maintain my Mac. It takes the effort out of installing everything manually. Everything which is needed to install my preffered setup of macOS is detailed in this readme. Feel free to explore, learn and copy parts for your own dotfiles. Enjoy! :smile:

## Your Own Dotfiles

If you want to start your own dotfiles from this setup, it's pretty easy to do so. First of all you'll need to fork this repo. After that you can tweak it the way you want.

Go through the [`.macos`](./.macos) file and adjust the settings to your liking. You can find much more settings at [the original script by Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos) and [Kevin Suttle's macOS Defaults project](https://github.com/kevinSuttle/MacOS-Defaults).

Check out the [`Brewfile`](./Brewfile) file and adjust the apps you want to install for your machine. Use [their search page](https://caskroom.github.io/search) to check if the app you want to install is available.

Check out the [`aliases.zsh`](./aliases.zsh) file and add your own aliases. If you need to tweak your `$PATH` check out the [`path.zsh`](./path.zsh) file.

One thing you'll need to do manually is add your `~/.zshrc` file. You can't symlink the `.zshrc` file from your dotfiles because Mackup will already symlink your `.zshrc` from your home directory. That's why we'll need to create the file manually. Add the contents below to a `.zshrc` file in your user directory. What it will do is load the `.zshrc` file from your dotfiles. Make sure that the path to your dotfiles is correct.

```zsh
# Load Zsh
source ~/.dotfiles/.zshrc
```

> I've thought about backing up the `.zshrc` file entirely to Mackup and removing it from this repo. But I like it to be versioned with the repo so I can use it for documentation and as an example. I also believe that it makes more sense to keep it in this repo because it's pretty tied into this repo's files and settings.

When installing these dotfiles for the first time you'll need to backup all of your settings with Mackup. Install and backup your settings with the command below. Your settings will be synced to your Dropbox so you can use them to sync between computers and reinstall them when reinstalling your Mac. If you want to save your settings to a different folder or different medium than Dropbox, [checkout the documentation](https://github.com/lra/mackup#supported-storages).

```zsh
brew install mackup
mackup backup
```

You can tweak the shell theme, the Oh My Zsh settings and much more. Go through the files in this repo and tweak everything to your liking.

Enjoy your own Dotfiles!
